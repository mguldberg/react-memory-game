# REACT based Memory Game

## About
A fun game where you need to try and pick through the images as they shuffle after each click.

Try to not pick the same image 2 times....all the way to up 12!

## Features
* Top right corner...set the 12 memory tiles to the topic of your choice!  It will do a giphy search for images that match that topic and your game will take on a completely different feel.
* High score is tracked per logged in session
* Current score is updated in real time

Enjoy!!

## Motivation
Create a project that demonstrates a front end made with REACT and linking that with an external API.
